## Sights
#### 1. Hollywood Sign / Wisdom Tree
Hollywood sign is a nice easy hike. There is plenty of parking in the nearby neighborhoods, where some will require you to pay a meter. If you hike the hollywood sign, you can also venture over to the tree. 

Hiking the hollywood sign will probably be a 1-2 hour venture, but with the tree hike, it'll take an additional hour probably. Highly worth it! The tree hike is a bit tougher.

#### 2. Santa Monica Pier / Venice Beach
Touristy beach with some carnival games, and street performers. There are some cool tide pools in the venice beach area.

#### 3. Malibu Beach
A little bit more to the west of the city, but these are beaches, which are not as crowded as the touristy Venice beach. There are also surrounding beaches here that are nice, such as Zuma beach. 

#### 4. Pasadena
Great place to bar hop.

## Food
#### 1. Urth Caffe
Great cafe for brunch, and/or lunch. If you watch Entourage, you know what this is.

#### 2. Portos
Great snack place!

#### 3. Korean BBQ (look on Yelp)
Literally any place w/ 4+ stars on yelp is good. 

## Nightlife/Drinking
#### 1. KTown
If you know someone who knows Korean, this area is great for going out!

#### 2. Pasadena bars
Bar hopping! Don't need to drive around.

#### 3. Perch
One of my favorite rooftop bars. Very classy place.

## Getting Around
Uber/Lyft are incredibly cheap within this city. I would use this solely because the subway system is not that great and the bus system isn't ideal.
