## Airports
#### 1. Lisbon Airport
To travel to the city center, you can easily take the metro, which will be aboue 15-30 minutes into the city centre. You can buy a one-way pass, or daily pass. There is also the aerobuses that go towards the city.

#### 2. Porto Airport
There is a metro line that goes directly to the airport, otherwise you can easily take an Uber, which is super cheap.

## Sights (Lisbon)
#### 1. Torre de Belem
It's a 16th century tower that serves as a monument to Portugal's Age of Discovery.

There's a nice park outside.

#### 2. Alfama (Sé Catedral, Miradouro da Nossa Senhora do Monte and Miradouro Portas do Sol)
Is a neighborhood filled with cobblestone streets.

#### 3. Sintra Palaces (Pena Palace)
A really picturesque palace. You pay for entrance into the entire park, and inside there are even more sights besides the Pena palace. All the sights feature nice viewing landscapes.

#### 4. Sintra ()
This is a really cool-kind-of park place with a mansion inside. It is kind of like Parc Guell in a way in Barcelona, in that you can explore and walk around for a couple of hours. Inside, there is a really cool well, that you can walk down a spiral staircase and there are multiple entrances/exits to this well. At the bottom of the well, you can exit and enter this waterfall area, that is really cool.

## Sights (Porto)
#### 1. Ponte de Dom Luis I
A super sick bridge.

#### 2. Cais de Ribeira
A boardwalk and pier to walk along. 

#### 3. 


## Food
Here, I briefly describe a couple of food places that are worth the HYPE. For locations, just use google, or yelp.

#### 1. Egg Tarts
The most famous place I went to was: 

#### 2. Estamine Art Food Drink (Thu - Mon 2:00 PM - 8:00 PM)

#### 3. Ramiro (seafood)
Great seafood place recommended by Anthony Bourdain, and lives up to it!

## Food (Porto)
#### 1. Puorto

#### 2. Gazela Cachorrinhos da Batalha

#### 3. Bota & Bira

#### 4. Tapabento

## Nightlife/Drinking
#### 1. Wine bars and Bar Hopping
To be honest, I don't feel like Portugal is known for any wild night life, so I just went bar hopping. It was quite fun.

## Nightlife/Drinking (Porto)
#### 1. Wine Quay Bar

## Getting Around
There is a speed train that goes between Lisbon and Porto, which you can take if you want to fit both cities onto your itinerary!

There is generally metro and buses that run within the cities! Pretty convenient.
