## Airports
#### 1. KEF Airport (Reykjavik)
This is the main international airport of Iceland! It is about 40 minutes away from Reykjavik and is about 20 minutes away from Blue Lagoon! It's quite a nice airport and has a great Joe & and the Juice.

#### Notes:

## Sights
#### 1. Skogafoss and Sejelsfoss

#### 2. Golden Circle (Thingvellir National Park, Geysir, Gulfoss, Crater Kerid)


#### 3. Snaesfellsness (Kikjufell, Kikjufellfoss, )

#### 4. 

#### 5. 

## Food
Here, I briefly describe a couple of food places that are worth the HYPE. For locations, just use google, or yelp. London has a ridiculous amount of people, so if you have 3+ people, I would highly recommend trying to make reservations in advance.

#### 1. Lanzhou LaMian Noodle:
Amazing handpulled noodle restaurant for any asian food cravings.

#### 2. Burger and Lobster:
Amazing burger and lobster. Simplistic and reasonably priced.

#### 3. Chick N Sours:
Great fried chicken place that is actually really healthy formulas for the fact that it is fried chicken!

#### 4. 

## Nightlife/Drinking
#### 1. Mr. Fogg's Residence
Great speak-easy looking place! Serves some interesting drinks, but can get quite pricey.

<!-- #### 2. Ministry of Sound -->


## Getting Around
You can definitely use the Underground, or just walk! UberX/Pool/Plus if necessary.
