Summary: A summary of environmental tips, tricks and reminders I learned about, or corrected.

Currently, a work-in-progress. If you feel that I'm missing anything, please let me know! I'm hoping this will be a light-weight resource for my friends and family and network.

# The goal is REUSE, and LIMIT CONSUMPTION

The overall goal of every single human being (that can afford to do so) should be to drastically reduce their consumption of materials and energy. With that in mind, I won't post things like "recycling plastic water bottles" because most plastic is unable to be recycled more than a few cycles and the goal there should actually be to ["reduce any plastic water bottle consumption"][1].

## Plastic

## Metal 

I won't mention commonly recyclable metals, such as soda cans, which typically can still be ["recycled for-profit"][1].

1. Razor blades
    - [Reducing/reusing tips] TBD
    - [Recycling tips] These can typically be collected in a plastic baggie that you put in the corner of your room and dropped off at your local recycling center. Note: these blades WILL usually be recycled.

## Old High-end Electronics

Electronics incur an environmental toll when done at scale. For example, silicon may deplete sand from an ecosystem. The lithium batteries may exact very harsh consequences on the natural surroundings. Overall, electronics like plastic water-bottles should be used as long as possible. `insert reference`

1. Smartwatches (e.g. Apple watches)
    - [Reducing/reusing tips] TBD
    - [Recycling tips] These can be sold online and/or sent in for recycling by the manufacturer (like Apple).

2. Laptops
    - [Reducing/reusing tips] TBD
    - [Recycling tips] These can be sold online and/or sent in for recycling by the manufacturer (like Apple).

### List of options for recycling electronics:

1. [Decluttr](https://decluttr.mention-me.com/m/ol/xr0rv-adam-decluttr) takes in old electronics listed above and gives you cash. Usually this is greater than the resale value from e.g. Apple itself. If they won't take it, remember you can still send it into the manufacturer most likely (e.g. Apple)!
