Title: Consulting
Slug: consulting

I have extensive experience in the following topics:

- epilepsy
- neural recordings (EEG, iEEG, ECoG, sEEG)
- causal machine learning (causal inference and machine learning)
- open-source scientific software (see open-science work)

I am always happy to chat and consult regarding any topics. My current rate for a 1 hour session is $350/hr. You can set the agenda and schedule accordingly with me by reaching out.

My payments go through Github Sponsors, which charges a very low fee for handling the transaction compared to all other sites: https://github.com/sponsors/adam2392?frequency=one-time&sponsor=adam2392.

Some examples of projects I have helped out with include providing strategy and knowledge about how to incorporate software with MNE-Python, how to best analyze EEG data, and how to leverage machine-learning techniques on low-sample size data.
