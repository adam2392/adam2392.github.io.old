Title: Open Science
Slug: openscience

I strongly believe sharing code, knowledge and data openly is a fundamental part of science, especially the computational sciences. I am involved in the development of many open source tools.

I am a [BIDS](https://github.com/bids-standard), [MNE](https://github.com/mne-tools), and [Neurodata](https://github.com/neurodata) team member. I am also a member of the MNE-Python [steering committee](https://mne.tools/dev/overview/governance.html). Specifically, I am a core-contributor to the following software packages:

- [MNE-Python](https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python): THE Python software package for MEG, EEG and iEEG data analysis
- [MNE-BIDS](https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-bids): A Python package for facilitating formatting and analysis with the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), which I am a core-team member for EEG and iEEG development.
- [MNE-Connectivity](https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-connectivity): A Python package for connectivity analysis using MNE.
- [MNE-HFO](https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-hfo): A Python package for high-frequency oscillation (HFO) detection using MNE.
- [SPORF](https://github.com/neurodata/SPORF): A package for training sparse oblique random forests.

I have also contributed to:
[pyDMD](https://github.com/mathLab/PyDMD), [pybids](https://github.com/bids-standard/pybids), [bids-validator](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-validator), [scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn) and [mlxtend](https://github.com/rasbt/mlxtend).

Recently (as of 2021), I am involved in an effort to add oblique trees to [scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn), which is tracked via this [Github issue](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/20819).

## Open Data

I have also contribute multiple BIDS-compliant datasets to https://openneuro.org, totaling 105 subjects across multiple publications.
