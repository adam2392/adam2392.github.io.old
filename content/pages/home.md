# About Me

I am a third year PhD student in biomedical engineering at Johns Hopkins University. I work with Dr. Sridevi V. Sarma in the [Neuromedical Control Systms group](http://sarmalab.icm.jhu.edu/).

I graduated from UCSD in 2015 with a double major in Bioengineering and Mathematics. I'm originally from Los Angeles, CA and consider myself a true CA native even though I wasn't born there (and don't even live there now).

I'm interested in applied mathematics, computational neuroscience, machine learning, data science, software engineering, entrepreneurship, hip hop and traveling to see the world's wonders. My coding languages (in order of proficiency) consist of Matlab, Python, Bash, Javascript, HTML, CSS, C/C++, MongoDB (and a little SQL), R, and Latex. I have experience with Django, Flask, Pelican (obviously), PBS/SLURM scheduling systems, Arduino, and Raspberry Pi.

My domain experience includes neuroscience, linear algebra, matrix theory, linear systems, and algorithms. Some things I've became interested in recently (as of 2015) are neural networks (specifically deep learning), bayesian statistics, malware and cybersecurity, differential geometry and eigenvalue problems.

Everything on this site reflects my personal views only. It'll generally range from research/science thoughts, to photo blogs, to travel blogs.
