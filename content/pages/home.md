# About Me

I am a third year PhD student in biomedical engineering at Johns Hopkins University. I work with Dr. Sridevi V. Sarma in the [Neuromedical Control Systms group](http://sarmalab.icm.jhu.edu/).

I graduated from UCSD in 2015 with a double major in Bioengineering and Mathematics. I'm originally from Los Angeles, CA and consider myself a true CA native even though I wasn't born there (and don't even live there now).

I'm interested in applied mathematics, computational neuroscience, machine learning, data science, software engineering, entrepreneurship, hip hop and traveling to see the world's wonders. My coding languages consist of Matlab, Python, Bash, C/C++, R, and Javascript. I have experience in Django, Flask, Pelican (obviously),
