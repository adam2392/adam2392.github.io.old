<h1>General Suggestions</h1>
<h2>Important Links</h2>
<h4>If you need airbnb (you'll get a free $40 off):</h4>
<p><a href="https://abnb.me/e/jRvXPz3dUH">https://abnb.me/e/jRvXPz3dUH</a></p>
<h4>If you need taxify (you'll get a free $5 off!):</h4>
<p><a href="https://invite.taxify.eu/EZN7D">https://invite.taxify.eu/EZN7D</a></p>
<h2>Airports</h2>
<h4>1. Prague International Airport | Vaclave Havel Airport</h4>
<p>It is highly recommended to get a taxi that for certain takes credit card. Most taxis will try to scam you and say their credit card machine stopped working. Ask before getting in!</p>
<h2>Sights/Activities</h2>
<h4>1. Kafe Damu</h4>
<p>There are 70 cent beers!</p>
<h4>2. Prague Castle</h4>
<p>If you like Prague Art and Architecture you will go into St. Vitus, and probably into St. Georges Basilica and to Golden Lane.</p>
<p>This is actually one of the most beautiful castles I've been to and has some really nice architecture. There are also a lot of museums around the area worth checking out.</p>
<p>i. Castle Gardens (not open in Winter)</p>
<h4>3. National Gallery in Prague</h4>
<p>TBD</p>
<h4>4. Parizska Street and Old Town Square</h4>
<p>Just a really old town area that is nice to walk through and appreciate the Czech architecture.</p>
<h4>5. Piss Sculpture in New Town (English book store with Shakespeare)</h4>
<p>This is just a really funny looking sculpture there. It also has a famous museum for the writer: Franz Kafka.</p>
<h4>6. Krizik Fountain</h4>
<p>TBD</p>
<h4>7. Charles Bridge</h4>
<p>This is the infamous Charles Bridge. A lot of tourists and people taking wedding photos. </p>
<p>Be sure to also check out their river tours to get another point of view of this famous and historical bridge.

<h4>8. Prague Clock Tower</h4>
<p>Really pretty looking clock tower.</p>
<h2>Food</h2>
<h4>Breakfast:</h4>
<h4>1. Globe Cafe</h4>
<p>Great breakfast and lunch for american food. Has Wifi and a great place to study. Good colonel Panini and French onion soup</p>
<h4>2. Bohemia Bagels</h4>
<p>Nice bagels.</p>
<h4>Lunch:</h4>
<h4>1. Kolkovna Celnice</h4>
<p>Snchnitzel is great with cornflake bread.</p>
<h4>2. Fried Cheese Stands (at end of Wenceclas towards National Museum):</h4>
<p>Street food.</p>
<h4>3. Sklep:</h4>
<p>Authentic Czech food.</p>
<h4>4. Nase Maso</h4>
<p>This is literally the best meat place you will ever find. It features some local butcher that also cooks some meat meals for you on the spot. There is always a line and they serve a really great cheeseburger, bone marrow, steak tartare and sausages.</p>
<h4>Dinner:</h4>
<h4>1. Ristorante Grosetto Marina – on a boat by the river, so good</h4>
<p>Nice restaurant and decently priced for being right on the river!</p>
<h4>Dessert:</h4>
<h4>1. ANGELATO</h4>
<p>Gelato.</p>
<h2>Nightlife/Drinking</h2>
<h5>1. Hemminway Bar – authentic absinthe</h5>
<p>This is the coolest absinthe bar ever! It features loads of cool drinks that are hand made by the bartenders and has some really cool photos and history behind it.</p>
<h5>2. Prague Beer Museum</h5>
<p>More than 30 beers on tap and you can buy taste cups. Gets crowded on the weekends though, but beer lovers must go here. It's not actually a museum)</p>
<h2>Must try beers:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Kout na Smunave </li>
<li>Staropramen (brewed in Prague)</li>
<li>Pilsner</li>
<li>Budweiser (the original)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Getting Around</h2>
<h4>1. Buses/Metro</h4>
<p>There are essentially 30 min, 90 min and full day passes that can be bought anywhere from 1-4 euros, which is incredibly affordable for a weekend in Prague!</p>
<p>There are a lot of hidden pieces of art within the metro. You also get access to trams, which are great to go around the city center. The metro/tram and most buses only run until midnight.</p>
<h4>2. Walking</h4>
<p>In my opinion this city is very walkable with all the cool looking architecture and historical areas all around the city.</p>
<h1>FAQ</h1>
<ol>
<li>Q: How do I get around?
Public transportation is recommended for far places, and then walking is nice!</li>
