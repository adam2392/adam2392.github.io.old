<h2>Airports</h2>
<h4>1. Lyon Airport</h4>
<p>TBD</p>
<h2>Sights</h2>
<h4>1. Basilisque Notre Dame Foire:</h4>
<p>Essentially another basilisque that is very beautiful and overlooks Lyon. It has an amazing view of the city. If you want nice lighting, I suggest coming in the middle to late afternoon. </p>
<p>It is located on Fourviere Hill. Note that Google maps shows a circular route to take up the hill, but there is a staircase at the bottom that goes straight up. You just have to find it :).</p>
<h4>2. Vieux Lyon:</h4>
<p>The historic area of the city that is pretty cool.</p>
<h4>3. Le Mur Des Canuts:</h4>
<p>This is a huge mural on the side of a building in the northern part of Lyon. It is incredibly picturesque and it's very fun to just try different poses to fit into the mural!</p>
<h4>4. Musée Des Beaux-arts de Lyon:</h4>
<p>This is the largest fine art museum after the Louvre in Paris. It is only 4 euros for a student, so it is highly recommended to go and check out some great art! There are some Monet pieces in here that are absolutely amazing.</p>
<h4>5. Parc de La Tete d’Or:</h4>
<p>This is a super cool looking park, known as the Golden Park.</p>
<h2>Food</h2>
<p>Here, I briefly describe a couple of food places that are worth the HYPE. For locations, just use google, or yelp.</p>
<h4>1. Slake:</h4>
<p>This is a fantastic coffee cafe that serves some great breakfast foods, like quiche, sandwiches and cookies. Highly recommend as a start off to your day.</p>
<h4>2. Yaafa:</h4>
<p>This is essentially a vegetarian falafel shop that is extremely affordable and absolutely delicious. I highly recommend coming here if you're just sick and tired of French food.</p>
<h4>3. Bollywood Tandoor:</h4>
<p>This is an authentic Indian restaurant that also serves a buffet style portion. It's not bad and pretty affordable too!</p>
<h4>4. Lyonnaise Cuisine:</h4>
<p>If you're going to be in Lyon, then you absolutely have to try Lyonnaise cuisine once. Go on Tripadvisor and make a reservation for a heavily reviewed restaurant. </p>
<h2>Nightlife/Drinking</h2>
<h4>1. Wine Drinking On the Rhone:</h4>
<p>Around the Rhone, there are walkways and bleacher type seats that you can just sit on and drink wine with your group. It is actually really beautiful, relaxing and affordable. </p>
<h2>Getting Around</h2>
<p>You can pretty much walk this entire city, but if you're feeling tired, Uber is plentiful!</p>
<h1>FAQ</h1>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Q: How do I get around?
A: Use uber, or the metro line.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Q: Where should I stay?
A: I would stay near the rivers Rhone and Saone towards the center of the city, else you'll spend an incredible amount of time walking/ubering.</p>
</li>
</ol>
