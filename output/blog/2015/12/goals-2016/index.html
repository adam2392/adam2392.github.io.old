		<div><p>Each year passes by faster and faster in my opinion, so I want to make the most out of 2016.Â As 2016 comes and 2015 comes to a close, I want to make some resolutions and goals for the new year.</p>
<ol>
<li>Spend more effort and time on good friends and ignore the rest.</li>
<li>
<p>This year I realized that even someone who you've known for years can exit your life in an instant. I want to spend more time and money on people that are there for you when you're up and down. When shit went down for me, people who I thought I could count on were nowhere to be seen. Why waste time and effort on those people?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Read more about politics and current events in our country.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think that coming from California is a blessing in many ways. However, I think that we take for granted all the things we have. There is a lot of different things happening around the country (e.g. politics) that I did not educate myself on. Using politico and pulse apps to keep up to date</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start choreographing again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Throughout undergrad, I made excuses for not trying more in dance to improve. Whether it was coursework, social life, or laziness, I didn't put in time and effort into my passion. Will try to do at least 1 piece and work on it throughout the year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enter in 1-2 jams.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Been bboying for almost 8 years and it has carried me through undergrad and high school. Want to continue going for top 8 in some big jams until I can't bboy anymore.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Begin taking photos and videos more during the year and documenting them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My dad gave me his old Nikon D5000 and I got a GoPro at the beginning of the summer. Photography is a way for me to keep involved in the hip hop scene once I can't dance anymore. Videos and photos are also great of documenting the year!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Continue blogging about graduate school and the milestones of a PhD in STEM.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are a lot of challenges and obstacles to overcome to get to a PhD program. There are also many to overcome whilst in the program. I want to talk about various events including: preparing for grad school in undergrad, applying for grad school, applying for fellowships, picking your rotations, picking your coursework, picking your advisor, choosing a thesis committee, structuring and studying for your DBO and then research on a daily basis. My goal is to graduate from this PhD as soon as possible (ideally 4-5 years) and start working to get industry experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run a half-marathon: Rock &amp; Roll Half Marathon in SD/DC</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Been saying that I wanna do this for years... time to get started.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spend less time on myself and volunteer more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spent too much time saying I wanna help out and not enough time doing. Getting involved in THREAD at Baltimore is one step and I hope to do more. The world is too big to just always be working on yourself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spend less time on social media (Facebook and Snapchat).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Good for seeing friends and chatting. Good for sending some updates once in awhile and documenting photos/videos. Not good for productivity. Aim: go from online once/day to once/two days this year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be content with paying my dues.</p>
</li>
<li>I've always been anxious to accomplish things. However, over the next 4 years, I realized it'll be grind and work. Gaining the technical skills so I can set myself up for maximizing the probability of succeeding in a technical startup. Just have to be patient and have this same dream when I'm 29.
All resolutions are goals in my opinion. The only real way to accomplish a goal that you set your mind to is work on them in minimal increments. Happy new years. It's going to be a good one.</li>
