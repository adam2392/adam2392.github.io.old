<h2>South Korea</h2>
<h3>Seoul Summer 2017 | July 8 - July 15</h3>
<p>Typical Sightseeing Places:
Namsan Tower - I went at nighttime and the views were really great! It's also where all the couples put their locks on a fence.</p>
<p>Gwanghwamun Palace and Gyeongbukgong Palace - if you're into historical stuff, these are some old temples you can check out.</p>
<p>Bukchon Village - a small traditional village with cute boutiques and restaurants that you can walk around if you want to get away from the super modern shopping areas.</p>
<p>Han River - it's nice to just sit along the river and have a picnic, or you can rent bikes and bike along the river too.</p>
<p>Cheonggyecheon Stream - also one of my favorite places. The stream is all lit up at night so it's very nice to stroll around there at night</p>
<p>Namdaemun Market - super cheap street market where you can get souvenirs, bags, clothes, etc. Kind of random but if you wear glasses they are also well known for having cheap glasses! I got a new pair of frames+lens for like $60 and they made it for me within an hour or so!!</p>
<p>Dragon Hill Spa - if you want to have the spa experience that you always see in kdramas, this is one of the largest spas in Korea (I think there are like 7 stories) and I remember they can speak Chinese/English so it wasn't too hard to communicate. Also they sell fried chicken on one of the floors and its really good!!</p>
<p>Shopping:
Hongdae - one of my favorite places in Korea! There's a lot of talented street performers (dancers, singers) so it's cool to see that side of Korean culture. Also there's a few cat cafes here, and also a trickeye museum which was really fun if you want to take trippy photos!</p>
<p>Myungdong - perfect to get all your shopping done in one place.</p>
<h2>China</h2>
<h3>Shanghai Summer 2016 | June 13 - June 23</h3>
